    <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
    <p>Deploying a Flask webapp to a testing server is a reasonably simple process.</p>
    <p>Configure a CI build script on your CI server to do the following:</p>
<pre>
export FLASK_CONFIG=CI &&
source .env &&
python3 run.py test
</pre>
    <p>This is assuming the current directory is the root of your Flask app where run.py is located.</p>

    <h3>Writing Tests</h3>
    <p>Inspect the folder <code>./ApplicationTests</code> to get an understanding on how tests are structured. It is recommended that you split tests cases into multiple files to allow easier access when a specific test needs to be worked on. </p>
