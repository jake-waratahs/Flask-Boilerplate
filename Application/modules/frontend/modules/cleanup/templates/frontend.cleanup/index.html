    <h2>Cleanup</h2>
    <p>Since this boilerplate comes with a large amount of examples and tutorial content, it is useful for it to be removable.</p>
    <p>All example modules and models will be removed.</p>

    <p>To perform a cleanup, at a command line, type <code>python run.py cleanup</code>. This command will only be available if the app has not been cleaned before.</p>
