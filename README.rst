Flask Boilerplate
================================================

Get started with flask MVC in 30 minutes. This boilerplate skeleton includes everything to get you up and running with flask. The collection of packages bundled with this boilerplate represents a selection of packages I have found extremely helpful when getting an app up and running as quick as possible.

This module is part of the flask-boilerplate project.

Features
